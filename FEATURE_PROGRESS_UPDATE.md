## üìù NOTES

- All core business features are now complete (~98%)
- Remaining features are primarily:
  - Infrastructure/DevOps (K8s, CI/CD)
  - Observability (monitoring, tracing)
  - Frontend enhancements (real-time, role-based)
  - External integrations (already have mock implementations)
  
- Circuit breakers and retry policies are infrastructure utilities that can be integrated into service-to-service calls as needed

- Export functionality supports both CSV (Excel-compatible) and JSON formats
